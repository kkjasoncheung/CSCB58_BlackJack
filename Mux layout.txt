USE THIS MUX CODE

http://electrosofts.com/verilog/mux.html


3 to 1 Mux for HEX0 and HEX1
- Inputs: regularRouletteOut, evenOddRouletteOut, drandnum (from BlackJack), q (choose game)
- Output: wire01 (to hex displays)
- Logic: If q == 0, connect regularRouletteOut as output ->  HEX0 and HEX1
	If q == 1, connect evenOddRouletteOut as output ->  HEX0 and HEX1
	If q == 2, connect drandnum as output -> HEX0 and HEX1

For HEX2 and HEX3 it will always be connected to prandnum. No need for a mux.

For HEX4 and HEX5
- Inputs: dealer (from BlackJack), q (Choose game)
- Output: wire45 (to hex displays)
- Logic: if q == 2, connect dealer as output -> HEX4 and HEX5
	else, output 0

For HEX6 and HEX7
- Inputs: player (from BlackJack), q (Choose game)
- Output: wire67 (to hex displays)
- Logic: if q == 2, connect dealer as output -> HEX6 and HEX7
	else, output 0

Things to do. 
1. Implement generic mux module.
2. create instances according to above.
3. Wire the generic wirexy to the hex instances
